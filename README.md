# SQL-MOST-RATED-MOVIE
In this work, I created a table where I added 20 movies. 
I have added 6 features to the table that will be evaluated such as persuasiveness, imdb score, originality, impressiveness, cinematography and how many times I have watched the movie.
For each criterion of a film, I wrote the query that adds one point to the film if the score of that criterion is above the average. Finally, I wrote the query that will bring the 5 films most suitable for my preferences by summing these points for each film.
